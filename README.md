# Garbage-Collection-System
This is a assignment problem from Mahdy's Research Academy

Smart garbage collection system with python oop

Let’s consider the sources of a city's garbage.
1. Household garbage
2. SME (Small and medium-sized enterprises) garbage
3. Industrial garbage
4. GO (Government Office) / NGO (Non Government Office) garbage
5. Transportation garbage
Let’s consider the types of garbage.
1. Biodegradable garbage
2. Non-biodegradable garbage
a. Recyclable garbage
b. Non-recyclable garbage

Now, we know what sorts of garbage we produce and types of that garbage.
The code is the design of a smart garbage collection system. The system has installed a bin in every source
(source-bin) mentioned above (1 to 5). Those bins are connected to the city-corporation's
garbage management plant bins (GMP-bin) by underground tunnels. A suction mechanism
transports the garbage from the source-bin to the GMP-bin. After collecting the garbage,
GMP-bin allocates them to 2 separate bins (Biodegradable/ B-bin and Non-biodegradable/
NB-bin). Non-biodegradable bin (NB-bin) further separates them to 2 separate bins (Recyclable/
R-bin and Non-recyclable/ NR-bin). Contents of the bins are then dumped to the plant for
processing.
